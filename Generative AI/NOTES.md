# Generative AI

## Day 1
### Introduction to Generative AI
* what is AI?
    * Artificial Intelligence is the Branch of Computer Science that deals with the creation of intelligent agents which are systems that reason and learn and act autonomously.
    * AI is the theory and development of computer systems able to perform tasks normally requiring human intelligence.
* Machine Learning
    * ML is the sub branch of AI.
    * It is a system of program that trains a model from input data.
    * ML gives computers the ability to learn without explicit programming.
    * 2 common classes of ML models:
        * Unsupervised ML models
            * This comes with UnLabeled Data.
        * Supervised ML models
            * This comes with Labeled Data (that data that comes with tags like name, type or a number).
* Deep Learning:
    * Deep Learning is subset of ML methods.
    * Deep learning uses Artificial Neural Networks - allowing them to process more complex patterns than traditional machine learning.
    * Artificial Neural Networks:
        * This is made by many interconnected Nodes or Neurons that can learn to perform tasks by processing data and making predictions.
        * This is inspired by human brain.
        * Deep learning have many Layers of Neural Networks that helps to solve complex patterns.
        * Neural Networks can use both labeled and unlabeled data.
        * Semi-supervised learning: In semi-supervised learning a neural network is trained on a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data, the labeled data helps neural networks to learn basic concepts of the task while the unlabeled data helps the neural network to generalize to new examples.

* Generative AI:
    * Generative AI is a subset of Deep Learning.
    * It used Artificial Neural Networks and process both labeled and unlabeled dat using supervised, unsupervised and semi-supervised methods.
    * Way to Know if a Model is Generative AI or not

* Large Language Models (LLMs):
    * These are also subset of Deep Learning.

* Deep Learning Models or Machine Learning Models types:
    * These can be divided into 2:
    * Generative
    * Descriminative

* Hallucinations:
    * Hallucinations are words or phrases that are generated by the model that are often nonsensical or grammatically incorrect.
    * It can be caused by :
        * The Model is not trained on enough data
        * The model is trained on noisy or dirty data
        * The model is not given enough context
        * The model is not given enough constraints

* Foundation:
    * A Foundation Model is an AI Model that is pre-trained on a vast quantity of data designed to adapted or fine tuned to a wide range of downstream tasks such as sentiment analysis, image captioning, and object recognition.
    * They can be use to detect fraud and provide personalized customer support.
