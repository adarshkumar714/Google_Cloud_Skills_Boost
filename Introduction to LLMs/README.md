# Introduction to Large Language Models ( LLMs )
### what are LLMs?
* LLMs are a subset of Deep Learning.
* LLMs and Generative AI intersect each other and they both are part of Deep Learning.
* These are called 'Large' 'cause of some reasons:
    * They are trained on an enormous (large) size of dataset some time in PB (petabyte).
    * They have Large number of parameters.
        * In ML, paramters are often called hyperparameters.
        * Parameters are basically the memories and the knowledge that the machine learned from the model training.
        * Parameters define the skill of a model in solving a problem such as predicting text.
